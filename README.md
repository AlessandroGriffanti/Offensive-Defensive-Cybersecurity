# Offensive-Defensive-Cybersecurity
This repository contains the binaries and relative solutions for various Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges taken during the Offensive and Defensive Cybersecurity Course at Politecnico di Milano.

The objective of the challenges is to find, indeed, the "flag", a string with the format FLAG{...}, mainly either by exploiting a vulnerability and/or reverse engineering.
## üìö Topics
The course covered a lot of topics concerning binary exploitation, from the simplest to the most advanced ones. More in detail, these were the topics covered: 

* [Shellcode](https://github.com/AlessandroGriffanti/Offensive-Defensive-Cybersecurity/tree/69aca32e550c12443475f03c1ef96dae3a7472fa/shellcode)

* [Reverse Engineering](https://github.com/AlessandroGriffanti/Offensive-Defensive-Cybersecurity/tree/69aca32e550c12443475f03c1ef96dae3a7472fa/reversing)

* [Mitigation Bypass](https://github.com/AlessandroGriffanti/Offensive-Defensive-Cybersecurity/tree/69aca32e550c12443475f03c1ef96dae3a7472fa/binary%20mitigations)

* [Returned Oriented Programming (ROP)](https://github.com/AlessandroGriffanti/Offensive-Defensive-Cybersecurity/tree/69aca32e550c12443475f03c1ef96dae3a7472fa/returned%20oriented%20programming)
