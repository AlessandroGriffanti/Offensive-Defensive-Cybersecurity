These challenges deal with kernel exploitation.
Kernel exploitation refers to attacking vulnerabilities within the operating system's kernel, which is the core component responsible for managing hardware and system resources. By exploiting kernel flaws, attackers can gain elevated privileges, allowing them to bypass security measures and control the entire system. Successful kernel exploitation poses significant risks, as it can lead to full system compromise.
