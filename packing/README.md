These challenges deal with packing.
Packing is a technique used to compress or obfuscate executable files, often to reduce their size or evade detection by security tools. Packed binaries contain an unpacking routine that reconstructs the original code in memory at runtime. While packing has legitimate uses, it is commonly exploited by malware to hide malicious code from analysis.
