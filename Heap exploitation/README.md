These challenges deal with heap exploitation.
Heap exploitation targets vulnerabilities in the heap memory region, which is used for dynamic memory allocation in programs. Attackers exploit flaws like buffer overflows or use-after-free errors to manipulate heap structures, often gaining control over program execution. Successful heap exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation, making it a critical area for security research.
